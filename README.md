You are a refined developer high in knowledge and skill/talent.  your friend asks you the below question!
 
"Tell me how to make this system even better at erasing debt with suggestions for upgrades!  Thanks!"
::::

DebtWad v0.1 Alpha Test

At first, just a simple ERc20 rERC20 <> pair of reflector and normal sharetoken.

--->  Debt eradicator via gamification and value infusion/utility.  Utilizing mechanism, then erc721 and then in v2 erc1155 advances.

--> Final goal on roadmap, Max size 1m DEBT ERASURE PROTOCOL.

------

Concept:

YOU bring us validated debt.  KYC to prove you are the person.... Or if you are a good enough greyhat...don't.  fake it>  we dont care, cuz we are debt AI breakers.  We break debt we don't give 1 flying fuck if you incentivized yourself to fake a person's ID to break their debts.  This is a whitehat use of a blackhat action, which we recognize as transmutative and valid as source Fuel.

Fuel:  You.  Your debt, or any debt.  Including.... National debts.  Pension debts.  THe biggest whales of debt on earth.  The cosmic debt, etc.  scalable to any size it can be vs equal value of.

Steam:  Reflector token.  pays the holders to incentivize the debt, rewards them 10% tax layer for holding.

Vapor:  The pollen in SourceCred 1hive sense.... in our Debt Master system of referal artists who use art to kill debt with an audience that auctions their art to itself as a show of patronage in private discord for NFT owners only etc.  Work payment token payable in debtWad/Fuel.

Goal:  Sell the debtWads.  Convince the audience debt is evil [yeah, that's hard .......not. ]  Gamify ways they can play games to burn it.  Burning it directly counts and they can then get an NFT that is usable for other ecosystem and game tokens in the family of systems.

'Scare' all hackers into becoming One.

How?  Incentivze the black and white hats against a common enemy in the legacy world.

Make them hack everyone to steal all the debt value......and mint real value for themselves of it.

Make the superhackers super rich via debt e-ray-sure protocol (tm) in v2.

Sell shares in tokenized things in the realms as erc1155 for group ownership to the reflector token owners as use.

Sell art in all the tokens switching randomly between them as to what is value or not.

Use the triple token arb NFTs thirdweb made to bias the flow of liquidity.

Keep liquidity to controllable systems, no out of control DEXs or sources where MEV bots can steal the value.  this is strictly forbidden as a standard/practice.  NO FIAT DIRECT, only via the debt layer and its paired token reflector, which are burnable for the other directly, as well as burnable to get art or 1155 shares.

ETC.
